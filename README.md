# Expected-Points-Model
For my final project in a Sports Analytics course, I wanted to use an Expected Points (EP) model to assist a hypothetical college football coach with their in-game decision-making. My first step was to build the EP model. In order to build the EP model, I needed to estimate the true distributions of certain discrete and continous variables that describe the flow of a college football game. To estimate these variables, I used Pro Football Focus' (PFF) 2019 College Football Dataset. In its original form, the dataset was messy so I used my wrangling, cleaning, and mining skills to manipualte the data in R Studio. Once I isolated my variables of interest and estimated their probability distributions, I applied my knowledge of "if-else" logic to build an EP model. Finally I used the model, to evaluate whether or not a coach should go for it on a 4th and 1 situation in a college football game. 

In the files above, you can find an R script that details the process I followed to manipulate the data and estimate certain probability distributions, another R script that features my Expected Points Model, and finally a pdf that expands upon my project topic of 4th and 1 situations.
